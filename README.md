# words-game

This is a personal Haskell programming language learn and practice project. The game-words exercise is implemented along with the Haskell training course from [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/).

words-game is a game to find programming language names in the grid with letters. There are 10 hidden programming languages listed in the grid. The words may occur in 2 possible directions horizontally, vertically and diagonally.
After typing a correct programming language, the player's score is increasing, and the language is being highlighted in the grid by turning it to upper case. The game will finish after finding all the 10 programming languages.
